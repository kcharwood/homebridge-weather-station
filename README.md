This is a weather plugin for [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) that features current observations, daily forecasts and history graphs. You can download it via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-weather-plus).

If you **update from a version before 2.0.0** you have to adapt your config. See the samples below. You might consider switching your weather service to the newly supported dark sky service.

## Choose your weather service

This plugin supports multiple weather services. Each has it's own advantages. The following table shows a comparison to help you choosing one.

## Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-weather-plus`
3. Gather an API key for a weather service from the register link in the table above
4. Update your configuration file. See the samples below.

## Configuration

Add one of the following samples to your config file.

### Dark Sky

The **key** parameter is the API key that you get by registering for a weather service in the table above.

The **location** parameter must be a list with the latitude longitude for your location (dont forget the square brackets). You can get them by looking up your location on Google Maps, click right and then selecting "What's here?".

The **language** parameter is *optional* and sets the translation for the description of the current day and condition. Available languages can be found [here](https://github.com/darkskyapp/translations/tree/master/lib/lang). Default is en.

The **forecast** parameter is *optional* and defines a list of forecast days to show starting with 1 for today, 2 for tomorrow etc. Default are none.

```json
"platforms": [
	{
		"platform": "WeatherPlus",
		"name": "WeatherPlus",
		"service": "darksky",
		"key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"location": [57.322956, -4.424380],
		"language": "en",
		"forecast": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
	}
]
```

### Weather Underground

The **key** parameter is the API key that you get by registering for a weather service in the table above.

The **location** parameter can be a city name or a zip. You can also use a station from the **[Personal Weather Station Network](https://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/overview.asp)** to receive weather information. Just enter pws:YOURID.

The **forecast** parameter is *optional* and defines a list of forecast days to show starting with 1 for today, 2 for tomorrow etc. Default are none.


```json
"platforms": [
	{
		"platform": "WeatherPlus",
		"name": "WeatherPlus",
		"service": "weatherunderground",
		"key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"location": "New York",
		"forecast": [1,2,3,4]
	}
]
```

### Advanced

You can add the parameter **interval** to set the update interval in minutes. The default value is 4 minutes.

## Example use cases

- Switch on a blue light in the morning when the chance for rain is above 20% today (or white when the forecast condition is snow / yellow when it's sunny).
- Start your automatic garden irrigation in the evening depending on the amount of rain today and the forecast for tomorrow.

**Hint:** To trigger rules based on time and weather condition you will need a plugin like [homebridge-delay-switch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-delay-switch). Create a dummy switch that resets after some seconds. Set this switch to on with a timed rule. Then create a condition rule that triggers when the switch goes on depending on weather conditions of your choice.
